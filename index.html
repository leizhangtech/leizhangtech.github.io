    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Lincoln and a member of the Laboratory of Vision Engineering (LoVE) research group. My work focuses on developing scalable and interpretable AI solutions that are theoretically robust, practically applicable, and beneficial to healthcare professionals and patients. My dedication lies in applying AI techniques, particularly in Multimodal, Interpretable and Causal AI, to address complex healthcare challenges. I have been pivotal in securing grants and driving development in numerous multidisciplinary projects, including those funded by EPSRC, Innovate UK, BBSRC, and CRUK etc. <br />
        <br />
        Currently, I also work as an AI research scientist in hospitals and clinics, where I provide consultancy on technical AI solutions, lead the development of scientific algorithms, and create commercial software tools to address challenging healthcare problems.
    </p>
    <p> My leadership in interdisciplinary teams fosters the exchange of knowledge and skills across different domains.</p>
